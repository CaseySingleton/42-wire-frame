# 42-wire-frame

Graphical project at 42 School Silicon Valley

Purpose:
- To learn how to render a simple 3D image using the MLX library to interact with XWindows
- Create a 3D wireframe using numbers from a file delimited by spaces
- Understand how to translate and rotate vectors using matricies
- Learn how to include and integrate frameworks into a Makefile

What I learned:
- How to open, interact, and close XWindows using the MLX library
- How key_hooks work
- Enough linear algebra to understand how to manipulate vectors using matricies
- How to create a 'combo-matrix' to keep calculations efficent
- How useful data structures are (this was my first time getting in depth with data structures)
- How to set variables equal to function pointers

Overall this was a very fun project! As I am now though, looking at my code, everything could have been so much better...
